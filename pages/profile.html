            (b. 2002, Virginia, USA) Anders Jensen is a graphic designer whose focus does not lie in a specific medium or material, but rather the intersections of digital and physical space, and the natural, intrinsic properties of material within each. Alongside print and bookmaking, he explores a variety of materials, processes, and methods of making such as carpentry, metal working, fiberglass casting, rusting, and sound. Through coding and websites, he intends to think of the handmade website as a generative space, not only for large projects, but smaller, intimate experiences as well. He completed his BFA in Graphic Design at Virginia Commonwealth University in 2024, and currently works as a Marketing & Communications intern at M.C. Dean in Tysons, Virginia, working towards a full time position within the field.
