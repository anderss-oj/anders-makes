                    <i>*hey, before you read, i encourage you to <a href="https://anders-makes.com/slowing.html">interact with the work here</a> first! (or don't, it's okay)*</i><br><br>
                    2024. <i>slowing… slowing… slowing…</i> slowing is the hand; slowing is transparency; slowing is personal; slowing is caring; slowing is natural; slowing is generative; slowing is a reduction; slowing is human. <br><br> The infinite and exponential growth proposed by capitalist systems inherently prioritizes speed and mass production, eliminating human aspects within the labor structure. In looking at the individual as a part of the whole, the larger structure can be looked at as a machine, minimizing individual impact and sense of self. In my own angst about my place within society as a designer, visualizing a means to work against the system manifests itself in material and processes. Inducing decay onto the material itself, is an act of bringing the steel back towards nature, fighting from the embodiment of massive, monolithic systems in place. The companion website presents a form of ‘rust’, induced by user interaction, developing over time in a digital environment. The web space acts as its own container for digital processes. In an exercise of material and process, this project is an exploration that is not meant to provide answers, but rather introduce questions and promote dialogue for alternative existences. <br><br> This sculpture and website were on display side by side at the 2024 VCU Graphic Design Senior Show from 5/3/24-5/10/24.
