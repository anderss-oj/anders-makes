                    2022. <i>the auto virtual</i> was a research project focused on documenting racing video games from the mid 90's to 00's, providing a curated mapping of the racing game environment of the time. Three subgenres emerged; simulator, simcade, and arcade. A broadsheet acts as a synthesis of imagery from the research on a 22x17 newsprint. Compiling the cd designs present what was the physical manifestation of these videogame experiences. In addition, 3 maps of the subgenres were made to navigate titles and developers. The maps came in the form of cd label designs and accompanying cd cases with back cover designs providing more information. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EtpVxCMny-9S0kNG2H4JMx7BGVf0ErD1/view?usp=sharing">Even more documentation is available here!</a>
