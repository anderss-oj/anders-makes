                    2022. In thinking about decay and the various forms it takes, <i>BitRot</i> is a research project publication stemming from the paradoxical reality of digital decay, or what is known as "bit rot." The term broadly encapsulates all forms of software and hardware degradation and deprecation, from software/code entropy, to planned hardware obsolescence. This project studied the nature of this phenomena and addressed the problems that arise, and preservation solutions available. Paired with this publication were two CDs, both containing a video file that emulates the effects of the rot. In an attempt to induce bit rot, one CD was held under UV light for an extended period of time. The concept of bit rot presents an interesting intersection between two media, questioning the disparity between the digital vs physical forms. <br><br> *you can <a href="https://youtu.be/87BXZSJL_iY">watch <i>rot</i> here!</a>*
